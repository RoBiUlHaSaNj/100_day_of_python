Variable Types:

x is an integer.
name is a string.
pi is a float.

print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>
print(type(name)) # <class 'str'>
print(type(pi))   # <class 'float'>
Arithmetic Operations:
# Addition
a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b  # result is 15
print(result)

# Subtraction
result = a - b  # result is 5
print(result)

# Multiplication
result = a * b  # result is 50
print(result)

# Division
result = a / b  # result is 2.0
print(result)

# Modulus (remainder after division)
result = a % b  # result is 0
print(result)

# Exponentiation (power)
result = a ** b  # result is 100000
print(result)


String Concatenation:

Combining name with " Hasan" to form full_name.

full_name = name + " Hasan"
print(full_name)  # Robiul Hasan

# Concatenation (joining strings)
first_name = "Robiul"
last_name = "Hasn"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # result is "Robiul hasan"
print(full_name)

# Repetition
laugh = "ha"
result = laugh * 3  # result is "hahaha"
print(result)
s = "please answer my question"
print(len(s))  # number of characters in s

Updating Variables:

You update x by adding 5 twice.

x = x + 5  # x becomes 15
x += 5     # x becomes 20
print(x)   # 20

Multiple Assignments:

Assigning values to a, b, c simultaneously.
Assigning 0 to x1, y, z simultaneously.

a, b, c = 1, 2, "Hello"
x1 = y = z = 0
print(a)   # 1
print(c)   # Hello
print(x)   # 20
Unpacking:

Extracting values from a list into variables.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)  # apple
print(y)  # banana
print(z)  # cherry
Output Variables:

Printing multiple variables of different types.
x=Python 
y=is
z=awesome
print(x, y, z)        # Python is awesome
x=5
y=10
z=10.5
print(x + y + z)      # 25.5 (when x=5, y=10, z=10.5)
y="John"
print(x, y)           # 5 John (x=5, y="John")
#print(x+y)  its not possible

Casting:

Converting types of variables.

x = str(3)    # x is now '3'
y = int(3)    # y is 3
z = float(3)  # z is 3.0
print(x)      # '3'
print(y)      # 3
print(z)      # 3.0

Combining Different Types
age = 25
name = "Alice"

# You can't directly combine an integer and a string:
# print(name + " is " + age + " years old")  # This will cause an error.

# Convert the integer to a string first:
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old")
